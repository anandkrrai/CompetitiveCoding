Setup for Pathsense Android SDK
===================================
1. Obtain a **Pathsense SDK Client ID** and **API Key** from [here](https://pathsense.com/). Click “GET STARTED” and enter your email address.

2. In **AndroidManifest.xml**, add the following elements as children of the &#060;application&#062; element, by inserting them just before the closing &#060;/application&#062; tag:

    ```xml
    <meta-data 
      android:name="com.pathsense.android.sdk.CLIENT_ID" 
      android:value="YOUR_PATHSENSE_SDK_CLIENT_ID" />
        
    <meta-data 
      android:name="com.pathsense.android.sdk.API_KEY" 
      android:value="YOUR_PATHSENSE_SDK_API_KEY" />
    ```

    * Substitute your CLIENT_ID key for YOUR_PATHSENSE_SDK_CLIENT_ID in the value attribute. This element sets the key com.pathsense.android.sdk.CLIENT_ID to the value of your Pathsense SDK Client ID.

    * Substitute your API_KEY key for YOUR_PATHSENSE_SDK_API_KEY in the value attribute. This element sets the key com.pathsense.android.sdk.API_KEY to the value of your Pathsense SDK API key.

3. Save AndroidManifest.xml.

4. Place **pathsense-android-sdk-location-bundle-release-4.0.0.0.aar** under **/libs**

5. In **build.gradle**, add the following:

    * to the **repositories** element:

    ```groovy
    repositories {
      flatDir {
        dirs 'libs'
      }
    }
    ```

    * to the **dependencies** element:

    ```groovy
    compile(name:'pathsense-android-sdk-location-bundle-release-4.0.0.0', ext:'aar')
    ```
    * for improved performance on Android Oreo and above add Google Play Services Location 15.0.1 or higher ***not required**
    ```groovy
    compile "com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:15.0.1"
    ```

6. Save build.gradle.

7. Re-build application.

How to customize notification (Android 7.1+)
===================================
The PathSense SDK runs as a foreground service. By default, it will show the PathSense icon and read "Pathsense is running". You can customize this notification, by adding pathsense.properties to the /assets folder of your app and setting the following properties:
 - icon_name: resource name of icon (i.e. drawable/icon)
 - ticker_text
 - content_title
 - content_text
