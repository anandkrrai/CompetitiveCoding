/*
Sum of all Submatrices

Problem Description

Given a 2D Matrix A of dimensions N*N, we need to return sum of all possible submatrices.


Problem Constraints

1 <= N <=30

0 <= A[i][j] <= 10



Input Format

Single argument representing a 2-D array A of size N x N.


Output Format

Return an integer denoting the sum of all possible submatrices in the given matrix.


Example Input

A = [ [1, 1]
      [1, 1] ]



Example Output
16


Example Explanation

Number of submatrices with 1 elements = 4, so sum of all such submatrices = 4 * 1 = 4
Number of submatrices with 2 elements = 4, so sum of all such submatrices = 4 * 2 = 8
Number of submatrices with 3 elements = 0
Number of submatrices with 4 elements = 1, so sum of such submatrix = 4
Total Sum = 4+8+4 = 16

/*
Solution Approach

Let us suppose the index of an element be (X, Y) in 0 based indexing, then the number of submatrices Sub(x,y) for this element
can be given by the formula Sub(x, y) = (X + 1) * (Y + 1) * (N – X) * (N – Y) .
This formula works, because we just have to choose two different positions on the matrix that will create a submatrix that
envelopes the element. Thus, for each element, ‘sum’ can be updated as sum += Sub(x,y) * A[x][y].

More Formally,
Number of ways to choose from top-left elements (X + 1) * (Y + 1)
Number of ways to choose from bottom-right elements (N - X) * (N - Y)

        int sum = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<A.length;i++){
            for(int j=0;j<A[0].length;j++){
                sum += ((i+1)*(j+1)*(A.length-i)*(A[0].length-j))*A[i][j];
            }
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
}
